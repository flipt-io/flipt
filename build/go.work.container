// This go.work file is used by the Dagger build container to enable
// multi-module workspace support. It allows commands like
// 'go run ./build/internal/cmd/gitea/...' to work correctly from the
// main module directory by making all submodules part of the workspace.
//
// This file is copied to go.work in the container during the build process.
