## Issues

Let me know how I can help!

* Include any **stack traces** with your error
* List versions you are using: Flipt, Go, OS, etc.
* List the contents of your Flipt configuration file. (ex: default.yml)

## Code

It's always best to open an issue before investing a lot of time into a
fix or new functionality.

Functionality must meet the design goals and vision for the project to be accepted; I would be happy to discuss how your idea can best fit into Flipt.

## Testing

New functionality must have accompanying tests. We aim to keep the total test coverage of the project above 80%.

## Legal

By submitting a Pull Request, you disavow any rights or claims to any changes
submitted to the Flipt project and assign the copyright of
those changes to Mark Phelps.

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (your employment
contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a PR.
Open an issue and someone else can do the work.

This is a legal way of saying "If you submit a PR to us, that code becomes ours".
99.9% of the time that's what you intend anyways; we hope it doesn't scare you
away from contributing.
