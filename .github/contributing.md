## Code

It's always best to open a dialogue before investing a lot of time into a fix or new functionality.

Functionality must meet the design goals and vision for the project to be accepted; we would be happy to discuss how your idea can best fit into the future of Flipt.

Join our [Discord](https://www.flipt.io/discord) to chat with the team about any feature ideas or open a [Discussion](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/discussions) here on GitHub.

### Conventional Commits

We use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for commit messages. Please adhere to this specification when contributing.

## Testing

New functionality must have accompanying tests. We aim to keep the total test coverage of the project above 80%.

## Legal

By submitting a Pull Request, you disavow any rights or claims to any changes
submitted to the Flipt project and assign the copyright of
those changes to Flipt Software Inc.

If you cannot or do not want to reassign those rights (your employment
contract for your employer may not allow this), you should not submit a PR.
Open an issue and someone else can do the work.

This is a legal way of saying "If you submit a PR to us, that code becomes ours".
99.9% of the time that's what you intend anyways; we hope it doesn't scare you
away from contributing.
