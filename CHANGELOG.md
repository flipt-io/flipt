## Unreleased

### Added

* `server` config section to consolidate and rename `host`, `api.port` and `backend.port`:

    ```yaml
    server:
        host:
        http_port:
        grpc_port:
    ```

* Implemented flag caching! Preliminary testing shows about a 10x speedup for retrieving flags with caching enabled. See the docs for more info.

### Deprecated

* `host`, `api.port` and `backend.port`. These values have been moved and renamed under the `server` section and will be removed in the 1.0 release.
