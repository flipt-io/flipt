# Licensing

There are currently two types of licenses in place for Flipt:

1. Client License
2. Server License

## Client License

All of the code required to generate GRPC clients in other languages as well as the existing GRPC Go client are licensed under the [MIT License](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html).

This code exists in the `proto/` directory.

The client code is the code that you would integrate into your applications, which is why a more permissive license is used.

## Server License

The server code is licensed under the [GPL 3.0 License](https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0.html).

If there are any concerns about the use of this license for the server, please [open an issue](https://github.com/markphelps/flipt/issues/new) on GitHub so that we can discuss publicly.
