# Configuration

There are two ways to configure Flipt: using a configuration file or through environment variables.

## Configuration File

The default way that Flipt is configured is with the use of a configuration file `default.yml`.

This file is read when Flipt starts up and configures several important properties for the server.

You can edit any of these properties to your liking, and on restart Flipt will pick up the new changes.

!!! note
    These defaults are commented out in `default.yml` to give you an idea of what they are. To change them you'll first need to uncomment them.

These properties are as follows:

| Property | Description | Default |
|---|---|---|
| log.level | Level at which messages are logged (trace, debug, info, warn, error, fatal, panic) | info |
| ui.enabled | Enable UI and API docs | true |
| cors.enabled | Enable CORS support | false |
| cors.allowed_origins | Sets Access-Control-Allow-Origin header on server | "*" (all domains) |
| cache.memory.enabled | Enable in-memory caching | false |
| cache.memory.items | Number of items in-memory cache can hold | 500 |
| server.host | The host address on which to serve the Flipt application | 0.0.0.0 |
| server.http_port | The port on which to serve the Flipt REST API and UI | 8080 |
| server.grpc_port | The port on which to serve the Flipt GRPC server | 9000 |
| db.url | URL to access Flipt database | file:/var/opt/flipt/flipt.db |
| db.migrations.path | Where the Flipt database migration files are kept | /etc/flipt/config/migrations |

## Using Environment Variables

All options in the configuration file can be overridden using environment variables using the syntax:

```shell
FLIPT_<SectionName>_<KeyName>
```

!!! tip
    Using environment variables to override defaults is especially helpful when running with Docker as described in the [Installation](installation.md) documentation.

Everything should be upper case, `.` should be replaced by `_`. For example, given these configuration settings:

```yaml
server:
  grpc_port: 9000

db:
  url: file:/var/opt/flipt/flipt.db
```

You can override them using:

```shell
export FLIPT_SERVER_GRPC_PORT=9001
export FLIPT_DB_URL="postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/flipt?sslmode=disable"
```

## Databases

Flipt supports both [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) databases as of `v0.5.0`.

SQLite is enabled by default for simplicity, however you should use Postgres if you intend to run multiple copies of Flipt in a high availability configuration.

The database connection can be configured as follows:

### SQLite

```yaml
db:
  # file: informs flipt to use SQLite
  url: file:/var/opt/flipt/flipt.db
```

### Postgres

```yaml
db:
  url: postgres://postgres@localhost:5432/flipt?sslmode=disable
```

!!! note
    The Postgres database must exist and be up and running before Flipt will be able to connect to it.

## Migrations

From time to time the Flipt database must be updated with new schema. To accomplish this, Flipt includes a `migrate` command that will run any pending database migrations for you.

If Flipt is started and there are pending migrations, you will see the following error in the console:

```bash
migrations pending, please backup your database and run `flipt migrate`
```

If it is your first run of Flipt, all migrations will automatically be run before starting the Flipt server.

!!! warning
    You should backup your database before running `flipt migrate` to ensure that no data is lost if an error occurs during migration.

If running Flipt via Docker, you can run the migrations in a seperate container before starting Flipt by running:

```bash
docker run -it markphelps/flipt:latest /bin/sh -c './flipt migrate'
```

## Caching

### In-Memory

In-memory caching is currently only available for flags. When enabled, in-memory caching has been shown to speed up the fetching of individual flags by 10x.

To enable caching set the following in your config:

```yaml
cache:
  memory:
    enabled: true
```

Work is planned to add caching support to rule evaluation soon.

!!! warning
    Enabling in-memory caching when running more that one instance of Flipt is not advised as it will lead to unpredictable results.

## Authentication

Flipt currently has no built in authentication, authorization or encryption as Flipt was designed to work inside your trusted architecture and not be exposed publicly.

If you do wish to expose the Flipt dashboard and REST API publicly using HTTP Basic Authentication, you can do so by using a reverse proxy. There is an [example](https://github.com/markphelps/flipt/tree/master/examples/auth) provided in the GitHub repository showing how this could work.
