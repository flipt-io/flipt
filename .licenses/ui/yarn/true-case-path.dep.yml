    \  TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR USE, REPRODUCTION, AND DISTRIBUTION\r\n\r\n   1. Definitions.\r\n\r\n
    \     \"License\" shall mean the terms and conditions for use, reproduction,\r\n
    \     and distribution as defined by Sections 1 through 9 of this document.\r\n\r\n
    \     \"Licensor\" shall mean the copyright owner or entity authorized by\r\n
    \     the copyright owner that is granting the License.\r\n\r\n      \"Legal Entity\"
    shall mean the union of the acting entity and all\r\n      other entities that
    control, are controlled by, or are under common\r\n      control with that entity.
    For the purposes of this definition,\r\n      \"control\" means (i) the power,
    direct or indirect, to cause the\r\n      direction or management of such entity,
    whether by contract or\r\n      otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent
    (50%) or more of the\r\n      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership
    of such entity.\r\n\r\n      \"You\" (or \"Your\") shall mean an individual or
    Legal Entity\r\n      exercising permissions granted by this License.\r\n\r\n
    \     \"Source\" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,\r\n
    \     including but not limited to software source code, documentation\r\n      source,
    and configuration files.\r\n\r\n      \"Object\" form shall mean any form resulting
    from mechanical\r\n      transformation or translation of a Source form, including
    but\r\n      not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,\r\n
    \     and conversions to other media types.\r\n\r\n      \"Work\" shall mean the
    work of authorship, whether in Source or\r\n      Object form, made available
    under the License, as indicated by a\r\n      copyright notice that is included
    in or attached to the work\r\n      (an example is provided in the Appendix below).\r\n\r\n
    \     \"Derivative Works\" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object\r\n
    \     form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the\r\n
    \     editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications\r\n
    \     represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes\r\n
    \     of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain\r\n
    \     separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,\r\n
    \     the Work and Derivative Works thereof.\r\n\r\n      \"Contribution\" shall
    mean any work of authorship, including\r\n      the original version of the Work
    and any modifications or additions\r\n      to that Work or Derivative Works thereof,
    that is intentionally\r\n      submitted to Licensor for inclusion in the Work
    by the copyright owner\r\n      or by an individual or Legal Entity authorized
    to submit on behalf of\r\n      the copyright owner. For the purposes of this
    definition, \"submitted\"\r\n      means any form of electronic, verbal, or written
    communication sent\r\n      to the Licensor or its representatives, including
    but not limited to\r\n      communication on electronic mailing lists, source
    code control systems,\r\n      and issue tracking systems that are managed by,
    or on behalf of, the\r\n      Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving
    the Work, but\r\n      excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
    otherwise\r\n      designated in writing by the copyright owner as \"Not a Contribution.\"\r\n\r\n
    \     \"Contributor\" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity\r\n
    \     on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and\r\n      subsequently
    incorporated within the Work.\r\n\r\n   2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject
    to the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License, each Contributor hereby
    grants to You a perpetual,\r\n      worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free,
    irrevocable\r\n      copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works
    of,\r\n      publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the\r\n
    \     Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.\r\n\r\n   3. Grant
    of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License,
    each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,\r\n      worldwide, non-exclusive,
    no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable\r\n      (except as stated in this section)
    patent license to make, have made,\r\n      use, offer to sell, sell, import,
    and otherwise transfer the Work,\r\n      where such license applies only to those
    patent claims licensable\r\n      by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed
    by their\r\n      Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)\r\n
    \     with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You\r\n      institute
    patent litigation against any entity (including a\r\n      cross-claim or counterclaim
    in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work\r\n      or a Contribution incorporated within
    the Work constitutes direct\r\n      or contributory patent infringement, then
    any patent licenses\r\n      granted to You under this License for that Work shall
    terminate\r\n      as of the date such litigation is filed.\r\n\r\n   4. Redistribution.
    You may reproduce and distribute copies of the\r\n      Work or Derivative Works
    thereof in any medium, with or without\r\n      modifications, and in Source or
    Object form, provided that You\r\n      meet the following conditions:\r\n\r\n
    \     (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or\r\n          Derivative
    Works a copy of this License; and\r\n\r\n      (b) You must cause any modified
    files to carry prominent notices\r\n          stating that You changed the files;
    and\r\n\r\n      (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works\r\n
    \         that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and\r\n          attribution
    notices from the Source form of the Work,\r\n          excluding those notices
    that do not pertain to any part of\r\n          the Derivative Works; and\r\n\r\n
    \     (d) If the Work includes a \"NOTICE\" text file as part of its\r\n          distribution,
    then any Derivative Works that You distribute must\r\n          include a readable
    copy of the attribution notices contained\r\n          within such NOTICE file,
    excluding those notices that do not\r\n          pertain to any part of the Derivative
    Works, in at least one\r\n          of the following places: within a NOTICE text
    file distributed\r\n          as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source
    form or\r\n          documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works;
    or,\r\n          within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and\r\n
    \         wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents\r\n
    \         of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and\r\n          do
    not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution\r\n          notices
    within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside\r\n          or as an addendum
    to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided\r\n          that such additional attribution
    notices cannot be construed\r\n          as modifying the License.\r\n\r\n      You
    may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and\r\n      may provide
    additional or different license terms and conditions\r\n      for use, reproduction,
    or distribution of Your modifications, or\r\n      for any such Derivative Works
    as a whole, provided Your use,\r\n      reproduction, and distribution of the
    Work otherwise complies with\r\n      the conditions stated in this License.\r\n\r\n
    \  5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,\r\n
    \     any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work\r\n      by
    You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of\r\n      this License,
    without any additional terms or conditions.\r\n      Notwithstanding the above,
    nothing herein shall supersede or modify\r\n      the terms of any separate license
    agreement you may have executed\r\n      with Licensor regarding such Contributions.\r\n\r\n
    \  6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade\r\n
    \     names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,\r\n
    \     except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the\r\n
    \     origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.\r\n\r\n
    \  7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or\r\n      agreed
    to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each\r\n      Contributor provides
    its Contributions) on an \"AS IS\" BASIS,\r\n      WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS
    OF ANY KIND, either express or\r\n      implied, including, without limitation,
    any warranties or conditions\r\n      of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY,
    or FITNESS FOR A\r\n      PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining
    the\r\n      appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any\r\n
    \     risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.\r\n\r\n
    \  8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,\r\n      whether
    in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,\r\n      unless required
    by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly\r\n      negligent acts) or
    agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be\r\n      liable to You for damages,
    including any direct, indirect, special,\r\n      incidental, or consequential
    damages of any character arising as a\r\n      result of this License or out of
    the use or inability to use the\r\n      Work (including but not limited to damages
    for loss of goodwill,\r\n      work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction,
    or any and all\r\n      other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor\r\n
    \     has been advised of the possibility of such damages.\r\n\r\n   9. Accepting
    Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing\r\n      the Work or Derivative
    Works thereof, You may choose to offer,\r\n      and charge a fee for, acceptance
    of support, warranty, indemnity,\r\n      or other liability obligations and/or
    rights consistent with this\r\n      License. However, in accepting such obligations,
    You may act only\r\n      on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility,
    not on behalf\r\n      of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,\r\n
    \     defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability\r\n      incurred
    by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason\r\n      of your accepting
    any such warranty or additional liability.\r\n\r\n   END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS\r\n\r\n
