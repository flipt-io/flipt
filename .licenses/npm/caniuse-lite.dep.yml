    to use material in ways otherwise restricted by\n     copyright and certain other
    rights. Our licenses are\n     irrevocable. Licensors should read and understand
    the terms\n     and conditions of the license they choose before applying it.\n
    \    Licensors should also secure all rights necessary before\n     applying our
    licenses so that the public can reuse the\n     material as expected. Licensors

    \    Considerations for the public: By using one of our public\n     licenses,
    a licensor grants the public permission to use the\n     licensed material under
    specified terms and conditions. If\n     the licensor's permission is not necessary
    for any reason--for\n     example, because of any applicable exception or limitation
    to\n     copyright--then that use is not regulated by the license. Our\n     licenses
    grant only permissions under copyright and certain\n     other rights that a licensor
    has authority to grant. Use of\n     the licensed material may still be restricted
    for other\n     reasons, including because others have copyright or other\n     rights
    in the material. A licensor may make special requests,\n     such as asking that
    all changes be marked or described.\n     Although not required by our licenses,
    you are encouraged to\n     respect those requests where reasonable. More_considerations\n

    \    equivalent rights anywhere in the world.\n\n  k. You means the individual
    or entity exercising the Licensed Rights\n     under this Public License. Your
    has a corresponding meaning.\n\n\nSection 2 -- Scope.\n\n  a. License grant.\n\n
    \      1. Subject to the terms and conditions of this Public License,\n          the
    Licensor hereby grants You a worldwide, royalty-free,\n          non-sublicensable,
    non-exclusive, irrevocable license to\n          exercise the Licensed Rights
    in the Licensed Material to:\n\n            a. reproduce and Share the Licensed
    Material, in whole or\n               in part; and\n\n            b. produce,
    reproduce, and Share Adapted Material.\n\n       2. Exceptions and Limitations.
    For the avoidance of doubt, where\n          Exceptions and Limitations apply
    to Your use, this Public\n          License does not apply, and You do not need
    to comply with\n          its terms and conditions.\n\n       3. Term. The term
    of this Public License is specified in Section\n          6(a).\n\n       4. Media
    and formats; technical modifications allowed. The\n          Licensor authorizes
    You to exercise the Licensed Rights in\n          all media and formats whether
    now known or hereafter created,\n          and to make technical modifications
    necessary to do so. The\n          Licensor waives and/or agrees not to assert
    any right or\n          authority to forbid You from making technical modifications\n
    \         necessary to exercise the Licensed Rights, including\n          technical
    modifications necessary to circumvent Effective\n          Technological Measures.
    For purposes of this Public License,\n          simply making modifications authorized
    by this Section 2(a)\n          (4) never produces Adapted Material.\n\n       5.
    Downstream recipients.\n\n            a. Offer from the Licensor -- Licensed Material.
    Every\n               recipient of the Licensed Material automatically\n               receives
    an offer from the Licensor to exercise the\n               Licensed Rights under
    the terms and conditions of this\n               Public License.\n\n            b.
    No downstream restrictions. You may not offer or impose\n               any additional
    or different terms or conditions on, or\n               apply any Effective Technological
    Measures to, the\n               Licensed Material if doing so restricts exercise
    of the\n               Licensed Rights by any recipient of the Licensed\n               Material.\n\n
    \      6. No endorsement. Nothing in this Public License constitutes or\n          may
    be construed as permission to assert or imply that You\n          are, or that
    Your use of the Licensed Material is, connected\n          with, or sponsored,
    endorsed, or granted official status by,\n          the Licensor or others designated
    to receive attribution as\n          provided in Section 3(a)(1)(A)(i).\n\n  b.
    Other rights.\n\n       1. Moral rights, such as the right of integrity, are not\n
    \         licensed under this Public License, nor are publicity,\n          privacy,
    and/or other similar personality rights; however, to\n          the extent possible,
    the Licensor waives and/or agrees not to\n          assert any such rights held
    by the Licensor to the limited\n          extent necessary to allow You to exercise
    the Licensed\n          Rights, but not otherwise.\n\n       2. Patent and trademark
    rights are not licensed under this\n          Public License.\n\n       3. To
    the extent possible, the Licensor waives any right to\n          collect royalties
    from You for the exercise of the Licensed\n          Rights, whether directly
    or through a collecting society\n          under any voluntary or waivable statutory
    or compulsory\n          licensing scheme. In all other cases the Licensor expressly\n
    \         reserves any right to collect such royalties.\n\n\nSection 3 -- License
    Conditions.\n\nYour exercise of the Licensed Rights is expressly made subject
    to the\nfollowing conditions.\n\n  a. Attribution.\n\n       1. If You Share the
    Licensed Material (including in modified\n          form), You must:\n\n            a.
    retain the following if it is supplied by the Licensor\n               with the
    Licensed Material:\n\n                 i. identification of the creator(s) of
    the Licensed\n                    Material and any others designated to receive\n
    \                   attribution, in any reasonable manner requested by\n                    the
    Licensor (including by pseudonym if\n                    designated);\n\n                ii.
    a copyright notice;\n\n               iii. a notice that refers to this Public
    License;\n\n                iv. a notice that refers to the disclaimer of\n                    warranties;\n\n
    \                v. a URI or hyperlink to the Licensed Material to the\n                    extent
    reasonably practicable;\n\n            b. indicate if You modified the Licensed
    Material and\n               retain an indication of any previous modifications;
    and\n\n            c. indicate the Licensed Material is licensed under this\n
    \              Public License, and include the text of, or the URI or\n               hyperlink
    to, this Public License.\n\n       2. You may satisfy the conditions in Section
    3(a)(1) in any\n          reasonable manner based on the medium, means, and context
    in\n          which You Share the Licensed Material. For example, it may be\n
    \         reasonable to satisfy the conditions by providing a URI or\n          hyperlink
    to a resource that includes the required\n          information.\n\n       3.
    If requested by the Licensor, You must remove any of the\n          information
    required by Section 3(a)(1)(A) to the extent\n          reasonably practicable.\n\n
    \      4. If You Share Adapted Material You produce, the Adapter's\n          License
    You apply must not prevent recipients of the Adapted\n          Material from
    complying with this Public License.\n\n\nSection 4 -- Sui Generis Database Rights.\n\nWhere
    the Licensed Rights include Sui Generis Database Rights that\napply to Your use
    of the Licensed Material:\n\n  a. for the avoidance of doubt, Section 2(a)(1)
    grants You the right\n     to extract, reuse, reproduce, and Share all or a substantial\n
    \    portion of the contents of the database;\n\n  b. if You include all or a
    substantial portion of the database\n     contents in a database in which You
    have Sui Generis Database\n     Rights, then the database in which You have Sui
    Generis Database\n     Rights (but not its individual contents) is Adapted Material;
    and\n\n  c. You must comply with the conditions in Section 3(a) if You Share\n
    \    all or a substantial portion of the contents of the database.\n\nFor the
    avoidance of doubt, this Section 4 supplements and does not\nreplace Your obligations
    under this Public License where the Licensed\nRights include other Copyright and
    Similar Rights.\n\n\nSection 5 -- Disclaimer of Warranties and Limitation of Liability.\n\n
    \ a. UNLESS OTHERWISE SEPARATELY UNDERTAKEN BY THE LICENSOR, TO THE\n     EXTENT
    POSSIBLE, THE LICENSOR OFFERS THE LICENSED MATERIAL AS-IS\n     AND AS-AVAILABLE,
    AND MAKES NO REPRESENTATIONS OR WARRANTIES OF\n     ANY KIND CONCERNING THE LICENSED
    MATERIAL, WHETHER EXPRESS,\n     IMPLIED, STATUTORY, OR OTHER. THIS INCLUDES,
    WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     WARRANTIES OF TITLE, MERCHANTABILITY, FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR\n     PURPOSE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, ABSENCE OF LATENT OR OTHER DEFECTS,\n
    \    ACCURACY, OR THE PRESENCE OR ABSENCE OF ERRORS, WHETHER OR NOT\n     KNOWN
    OR DISCOVERABLE. WHERE DISCLAIMERS OF WARRANTIES ARE NOT\n     ALLOWED IN FULL
    OR IN PART, THIS DISCLAIMER MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n  b. TO THE EXTENT POSSIBLE,
    IN NO EVENT WILL THE LICENSOR BE LIABLE\n     TO YOU ON ANY LEGAL THEORY (INCLUDING,
    WITHOUT LIMITATION,\n     NEGLIGENCE) OR OTHERWISE FOR ANY DIRECT, SPECIAL, INDIRECT,\n
    \    INCIDENTAL, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE, EXEMPLARY, OR OTHER LOSSES,\n     COSTS,
    EXPENSES, OR DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THIS PUBLIC LICENSE OR\n     USE OF THE LICENSED
    MATERIAL, EVEN IF THE LICENSOR HAS BEEN\n     ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
    LOSSES, COSTS, EXPENSES, OR\n     DAMAGES. WHERE A LIMITATION OF LIABILITY IS
    NOT ALLOWED IN FULL OR\n     IN PART, THIS LIMITATION MAY NOT APPLY TO YOU.\n\n
    \ c. The disclaimer of warranties and limitation of liability provided\n     above
    shall be interpreted in a manner that, to the extent\n     possible, most closely
    approximates an absolute disclaimer and\n     waiver of all liability.\n\n\nSection
    6 -- Term and Termination.\n\n  a. This Public License applies for the term of
    the Copyright and\n     Similar Rights licensed here. However, if You fail to
    comply with\n     this Public License, then Your rights under this Public License\n
    \    terminate automatically.\n\n  b. Where Your right to use the Licensed Material
    has terminated under\n     Section 6(a), it reinstates:\n\n       1. automatically
    as of the date the violation is cured, provided\n          it is cured within
    30 days of Your discovery of the\n          violation; or\n\n       2. upon express
    reinstatement by the Licensor.\n\n     For the avoidance of doubt, this Section
    6(b) does not affect any\n     right the Licensor may have to seek remedies for
    Your violations\n     of this Public License.\n\n  c. For the avoidance of doubt,
    the Licensor may also offer the\n     Licensed Material under separate terms or
    conditions or stop\n     distributing the Licensed Material at any time; however,
    doing so\n     will not terminate this Public License.\n\n  d. Sections 1, 5,
    6, 7, and 8 survive termination of this Public\n     License.\n\n\nSection 7 --
    Other Terms and Conditions.\n\n  a. The Licensor shall not be bound by any additional
    or different\n     terms or conditions communicated by You unless expressly agreed.\n\n
    \ b. Any arrangements, understandings, or agreements regarding the\n     Licensed
    Material not stated herein are separate from and\n     independent of the terms
    and conditions of this Public License.\n\n\nSection 8 -- Interpretation.\n\n  a.
    For the avoidance of doubt, this Public License does not, and\n     shall not
    be interpreted to, reduce, limit, restrict, or impose\n     conditions on any
    use of the Licensed Material that could lawfully\n     be made without permission
    under this Public License.\n\n  b. To the extent possible, if any provision of
    this Public License is\n     deemed unenforceable, it shall be automatically reformed
    to the\n     minimum extent necessary to make it enforceable. If the provision\n
    \    cannot be reformed, it shall be severed from this Public License\n     without
    affecting the enforceability of the remaining terms and\n     conditions.\n\n
    \ c. No term or condition of this Public License will be waived and no\n     failure
    to comply consented to unless expressly agreed to by the\n     Licensor.\n\n  d.
    Nothing in this Public License constitutes or may be interpreted\n     as a limitation
    upon, or waiver of, any privileges and immunities\n     that apply to the Licensor
    or You, including from the legal\n     processes of any jurisdiction or authority.\n\n\n=======================================================================\n\nCreative
