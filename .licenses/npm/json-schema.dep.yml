      Academic Free License, v. 2.1:\n**********************************\n\nThis Academic
      Free License (the \"License\") applies to any original work of\nauthorship (the
      \"Original Work\") whose owner (the \"Licensor\") has placed the\nfollowing notice
      immediately following the copyright notice for the Original\nWork:\n\nLicensed
      under the Academic Free License version 2.1\n\n1) Grant of Copyright License.
      Licensor hereby grants You a world-wide,\nroyalty-free, non-exclusive, perpetual,
      sublicenseable license to do the\nfollowing:\n\na) to reproduce the Original Work

      for sale the\nOriginal Work and Derivative Works.\n\n3) Grant of Source Code License.
      The term \"Source Code\" means the preferred\nform of the Original Work for making
      modifications to it and all available\ndocumentation describing how to modify
      the Original Work. Licensor hereby\nagrees to provide a machine-readable copy
      of the Source Code of the Original\nWork along with each copy of the Original
      Work that Licensor distributes.\nLicensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation
      by placing a\nmachine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository\nreasonably
      calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as\nlong as
      Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing\nthe address
      of that information repository in a notice immediately following\nthe copyright
      notice that applies to the Original Work.\n\n4) Exclusions From License Grant.
      Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names\nof any contributors to the Original
      Work, nor any of their trademarks or\nservice marks, may be used to endorse or
      promote products derived from this\nOriginal Work without express prior written
      permission of the Licensor. Nothing\nin this License shall be deemed to grant
      any rights to trademarks, copyrights,\npatents, trade secrets or any other intellectual
      property of Licensor except as\nexpressly stated herein. No patent license is
      granted to make, use, sell or\noffer to sell embodiments of any patent claims
      other than the licensed claims\ndefined in Section 2. No right is granted to the
      trademarks of Licensor even if\nsuch marks are included in the Original Work.
      Nothing in this License shall be\ninterpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing
      under different terms from this\nLicense any Original Work that Licensor otherwise
      would have a right to\nlicense.\n\n5) This section intentionally omitted.\n\n6)
      Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative\nWorks
      that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the\nSource Code
      of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any\ndescriptive
      text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause\nthe Source
      Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent\nAttribution
      Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have\nmodified the
      Original Work.\n\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor
      warrants that\nthe copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights
      granted herein\nby Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You
      under the terms\nof this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of
      those copyrights\nand patent rights. Except as expressly stated in the immediately
      proceeding\nsentence, the Original Work is provided under this License on an \"AS
      IS\" BASIS\nand WITHOUT WARRANTY, either express or implied, including, without
      limitation,\nthe warranties of NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY or FITNESS FOR
      A PARTICULAR\nPURPOSE. THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY OF THE ORIGINAL WORK
      IS WITH YOU.\nThis DISCLAIMER OF WARRANTY constitutes an essential part of this
      License. No\nlicense to Original Work is granted hereunder except under this disclaimer.\n\n8)
      Limitation of Liability. Under no circumstances and under no legal theory,\nwhether
      in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the\nLicensor be
      liable to any person for any direct, indirect, special, incidental,\nor consequential
      damages of any character arising as a result of this License\nor the use of the
      Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss\nof goodwill, work
      stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\nother commercial damages
      or losses. This limitation of liability shall not\napply to liability for death
      or personal injury resulting from Licensor's\nnegligence to the extent applicable
      law prohibits such limitation. Some\njurisdictions do not allow the exclusion
      or limitation of incidental or\nconsequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation
      may not apply to You.\n\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies
      of the Original Work or\na Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort
      under the circumstances to\nobtain the express assent of recipients to the terms

      between Licensor and You)\ngrants You permission to create Derivative Works based
      upon the Original Work\nor to exercise any of the rights granted in Section 1
      herein, and any attempt\nto do so except under the terms of this License (or another
      written agreement\nbetween Licensor and You) is expressly prohibited by U.S. copyright
      law, the\nequivalent laws of other countries, and by international treaty. Therefore,
      by\nexercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate\nYour
      acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.\n\n10) Termination
      for Patent Action. This License shall terminate automatically\nand You may no
      longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License\nas of the date
      You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim,\nagainst Licensor
      or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a\npatent. This termination
      provision shall not apply for an action alleging\npatent infringement by combinations
      of the Original Work with other software or\nhardware.\n\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue
      and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this\nLicense may be brought
      only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the\nLicensor resides or in which
      Licensor conducts its primary business, and under\nthe laws of that jurisdiction
      excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The\napplication of the United Nations
      Convention on Contracts for the International\nSale of Goods is expressly excluded.
      Any use of the Original Work outside the\nscope of this License or after its termination
      shall be subject to the\nrequirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act,
      17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et\nseq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international
      treaty. This\nsection shall survive the termination of this License.\n\n12) Attorneys
      Fees. In any action to enforce the terms of this License or\nseeking damages relating
      thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to\nrecover its costs and expenses,
      including, without limitation, reasonable\nattorneys' fees and costs incurred
      in connection with such action, including\nany appeal of such action. This section
      shall survive the termination of this\nLicense.\n\n13) Miscellaneous. This License
      represents the complete agreement concerning\nthe subject matter hereof. If any
      provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be
      reformed only to the extent necessary to\nmake it enforceable.\n\n14) Definition
      of \"You\" in This License. \"You\" throughout this License, whether\nin upper
      or lower case, means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights\nunder,
      and complying with all of the terms of, this License. For legal\nentities, \"You\"
      includes any entity that controls, is controlled by, or is\nunder common control
      with you. For purposes of this definition, \"control\" means\n(i) the power, direct
      or indirect, to cause the direction or management of such\nentity, whether by
      contract or otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent\n(50%) or more of the
      outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such\nentity.\n\n15) Right
      to Use. You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise\nrestricted or
      conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not\nto interfere
      with or be responsible for such uses by You.\n\nThis license is Copyright (C)
