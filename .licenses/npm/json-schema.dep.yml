    Academic Free License, v. 2.1:\n**********************************\n\nThis Academic
    Free License (the \"License\") applies to any original work of\nauthorship (the

    The term \"Source Code\" means the preferred\nform of the Original Work for making
    modifications to it and all available\ndocumentation describing how to modify
    the Original Work. Licensor hereby\nagrees to provide a machine-readable copy
    of the Source Code of the Original\nWork along with each copy of the Original
    Work that Licensor distributes.\nLicensor reserves the right to satisfy this obligation
    by placing a\nmachine-readable copy of the Source Code in an information repository\nreasonably
    calculated to permit inexpensive and convenient access by You for as\nlong as
    Licensor continues to distribute the Original Work, and by publishing\nthe address
    of that information repository in a notice immediately following\nthe copyright
    notice that applies to the Original Work.\n\n4) Exclusions From License Grant.
    Neither the names of Licensor, nor the names\nof any contributors to the Original
    Work, nor any of their trademarks or\nservice marks, may be used to endorse or

    property of Licensor except as\nexpressly stated herein. No patent license is
    granted to make, use, sell or\noffer to sell embodiments of any patent claims
    other than the licensed claims\ndefined in Section 2. No right is granted to the
    trademarks of Licensor even if\nsuch marks are included in the Original Work.
    Nothing in this License shall be\ninterpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing
    under different terms from this\nLicense any Original Work that Licensor otherwise
    would have a right to\nlicense.\n\n5) This section intentionally omitted.\n\n6)
    Attribution Rights. You must retain, in the Source Code of any Derivative\nWorks
    that You create, all copyright, patent or trademark notices from the\nSource Code
    of the Original Work, as well as any notices of licensing and any\ndescriptive
    text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice.\" You must cause\nthe Source
    Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent\nAttribution
    Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have\nmodified the
    Original Work.\n\n7) Warranty of Provenance and Disclaimer of Warranty. Licensor
    warrants that\nthe copyright in and to the Original Work and the patent rights
    granted herein\nby Licensor are owned by the Licensor or are sublicensed to You
    under the terms\nof this License with the permission of the contributor(s) of

    stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all\nother commercial damages
    or losses. This limitation of liability shall not\napply to liability for death
    or personal injury resulting from Licensor's\nnegligence to the extent applicable
    law prohibits such limitation. Some\njurisdictions do not allow the exclusion
    or limitation of incidental or\nconsequential damages, so this exclusion and limitation
    may not apply to You.\n\n9) Acceptance and Termination. If You distribute copies
    of the Original Work or\na Derivative Work, You must make a reasonable effort
    under the circumstances to\nobtain the express assent of recipients to the terms

    by\nexercising any of the rights granted to You in Section 1 herein, You indicate\nYour
    acceptance of this License and all of its terms and conditions.\n\n10) Termination

    of the Original Work with other software or\nhardware.\n\n11) Jurisdiction, Venue
    and Governing Law. Any action or suit relating to this\nLicense may be brought
    only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the\nLicensor resides or in which
    Licensor conducts its primary business, and under\nthe laws of that jurisdiction
    excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The\napplication of the United Nations
    Convention on Contracts for the International\nSale of Goods is expressly excluded.
    Any use of the Original Work outside the\nscope of this License or after its termination
    shall be subject to the\nrequirements and penalties of the U.S. Copyright Act,
    17 U.S.C. Â§ 101 et\nseq., the equivalent laws of other countries, and international
    treaty. This\nsection shall survive the termination of this License.\n\n12) Attorneys

    provision of this License is held to be\nunenforceable, such provision shall be
