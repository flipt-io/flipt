name: github.com/joho/godotenv
version: v1.3.0
type: go
summary: Package godotenv is a go port of the ruby dotenv library (https://github.com/bkeepers/dotenv)
  Examples/readme can be found on the github page at https://github.com/joho/godotenv
  The TL;DR is that you make a .env file that looks something like SOME_ENV_VAR=somevalue
  and then in your go code you can call godotenv.Load() and all the env vars declared
  in .env will be available through os.Getenv("SOME_ENV_VAR")
