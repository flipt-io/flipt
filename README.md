## Documentation

## What is Flipt

Flipt is an open source feature flag application that allows you to run experiments across services in **your** environment.

This means that you can deploy Flipt within your existing infrastructure and not have to worry about your information being sent to a third party or the latency required to communicate across the internet.

Flipt includes native client SDKs as well as a REST API so you can choose how to best integrate Flipt with your applications.

## Why Flipt

Flipt allows you to focus on building your applications without having to worry about implementing your own [feature flag](https://martinfowler.com/bliki/FeatureToggle.html) solution that works across your entire infrastructure.

With Flipt you can:

* Use simple on/off feature flags to toggle functionality in your applications
* Rollout features to a subset of your audience
* Use advanced segmentation to target and serve users based on custom properties that you define

On top of all this, Flipt provides a clean, modern UI so that you can always monitor the state of your feature flags and experiments in a single place.

## Features

* Fast. Written in Go. Optimized for performance
* Stand alone, easy to run and configure
* Ability to create advanced distribution rules to target segments of users
* Native [GRPC](https://grpc.io/) client SDKs to integrate with your applications
* Simple REST API
* Modern UI and debug console
* Support for multiple databases

## Running Flipt

Flipt is a single, self contained binary that you run on your own servers or cloud infrastructure. There are a multitude of benefits to running Flipt yourself, including:

* :lock: **Security** - No data leaves your servers and you don't have to open your systems to the outside world to communicate with Flipt. It all runs within your existing infrastructure.
* :rocket: **Speed** - Since Flipt is co-located with your existing services, you do not have to communicate across the internet to another application running on the other side of the world which can add excessive latency and slow down your applications.
* :white_check_mark: **Simplicity** - Flipt is a single binary with no external dependencies by default.

### Try It

```bash
‚ùØ docker run --rm -p 8080:8080 -p 9000:9000 markphelps/flipt:latest
```

Flipt UI will now be reachable at [http://localhost:8080/](http://localhost:8080).

For more permanent methods of running Flipt, see the [Installation](https://flipt.dev/installation/) section.

### :warning: Beta Software :warning:

Flipt is still considered beta software until the 1.0.0 release. This means that there are likely bugs and features/configuration may change between releases. Attempts will be made to maintain backwards compatibility whenever possible.

### Clients

There are two ways to communicate with the Flipt server from your applications:

1. [GRPC](https://grpc.io/)
1. REST API

To figure out which best supports your usecase and how to get client(s) in your preferred language, see the [Integration](https://flipt.dev/integration/) docs.

#### Official Clients

* [markphelps/flipt-grpc-go](https://github.com/markphelps/flipt-grpc-go) - Go GRPC client (Go)

#### Third-Party Client Libraries

Client libraries built by awesome people from the Open Source community:

* [Camji55/Flipt-iOS-SDK](https://github.com/Camji55/Flipt-iOS-SDK) - Native iOS SDK for Flipt (Swift)
* [christopherdiehl/rflipt](https://github.com/christopherdiehl/rflipt) - React components/example project to control React features backed by Flipt (React)

### Databases

Flipt supports **both** [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org/index.html) and [Postgres](https://www.postgresql.org/) databases as of [v0.5.0](https://github.com/markphelps/flipt/releases/tag/v0.5.0).

SQLite is enabled by default for simplicity, however you should use Postgres if you intend to run multiple copies of Flipt in a high availability configuration.

See the [Configuration](https://flipt.dev/configuration/#databases) documentation for more information.

## Licensing

There are currently two types of licenses in place for Flipt:

1. Client License
2. Server License

### Client License

All of the code required to generate GRPC clients in other languages as well as the existing GRPC Go client are licensed under the [MIT License](https://spdx.org/licenses/MIT.html).

This code exists in the [rpc/](rpc/) directory.

The client code is the code that you would integrate into your applications, which is why a more permissive license is used.

### Server License

The server code is licensed under the [GPL 3.0 License](https://spdx.org/licenses/GPL-3.0.html).

If there are any concerns about the use of this license for the server, please [open an issue](https://github.com/markphelps/flipt/issues/new) on GitHub so that we can discuss publicly.
