> [!NOTE]  
> **Looking for Flipt v1?** You can find the v1 code on the [`main` branch](https://github.com/flipt-io/flipt/tree/main) and documentation at [docs.flipt.io](https://docs.flipt.io/).

## Why Flipt v2?

**Finally, feature flags that work with your existing Git workflow.**

Flipt v2 is the first truly Git-native feature management platform that treats your feature flags as code. Store your flags in your own Git repositories, use your existing branching strategy, and deploy flags alongside your code using the tools you already know and trust.

### üöÄ **Git-Native by Design**

- **Own your data**: Store feature flags directly in your Git repositories
- **Version control**: Full history and blame for every flag change
- **Branch and merge**: Test flag changes in branches before merging to production
- **Deploy together**: Feature flags deploy with your code using existing CI/CD pipelines

### üåç **Multi-Environment with Git Flexibility**

- **Environment per branch**: Map environments to Git branches for seamless workflows  
- **Environment per directory**: Organize flags by microservice or team within a single repo
- **Environment per repository**: Separate repos for different products or security domains
- **Complete isolation**: Each environment has its own namespaces, flags, and configurations

### ‚ö° **Developer Experience First**

- **Zero infrastructure**: No databases, no external dependencies by default
- **GitOps ready**: Works with existing Git-based deployment workflows
- **Real-time updates**: Streaming API for instant flag propagation
- **Modern UI**: Intuitive interface with full Git integration and dark mode support

### üîí **Enterprise Security & Control**

- **Self-hosted**: Keep sensitive flag data within your infrastructure
- **Merge proposals**: Code review workflow for flag changes (commercial feature)
- **Audit trails**: Complete history of who changed what and when
- **OIDC/JWT/OAuth**: Enterprise authentication methods supported

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> V2 of Flipt is currently in beta release status. We may make breaking changes to the UI and API until we reach a stable release.

## Flipt v1 vs v2: What's New?

| Feature | Flipt v1 | Flipt v2 |
|---------|----------|----------|
| **Storage** | Database-centric (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) | Git-native with optional SCM sync (GitHub, GitLab, Gitea, etc.) |
| **Environments** | Single namespace model | Multi-environment with Git flexibility |
| **Branching** | Not supported | Full Git branching with environment branches |
| **Data Ownership** | Stored in a database (MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQLite) | Stored in your Git repositories alongside your code |
| **GitOps** | Read-only Git integration | Full read/write Git integration |
| **Deployment** | Requires database setup | Zero dependencies - single binary |
| **Version Control** | Basic audit logs | Full Git history and blame |
| **Merge Process** | Direct flag changes | Merge proposals with code review |
| **Real-time Updates** | Polling required | Streaming API for instant updates |
| **Multi-tenancy** | Manual namespace management | Environment-based isolation |

<!-- 
TODO: uncomment once we have a migration guide
**Migration path**: Flipt v2 maintains backwards compatibility with v1 APIs, making migration straightforward. Read our [migration guide](https://docs.flipt.io/v2/guides/migration) for details. -->

## Use Cases

Perfect for engineering teams that want to:

- **Ship faster with confidence**: Deploy flags with your code using existing Git workflows
- **Enable trunk-based development**: Merge incomplete features behind flags without risk
- **Implement proper GitOps**: Treat infrastructure and feature flags as code
- **Maintain security compliance**: Keep sensitive flag data within your infrastructure  
- **Scale with multiple environments**: Manage flags across dev, staging, and production seamlessly
- **Enable team collaboration**: Use familiar Git workflows for flag reviews and approvals
